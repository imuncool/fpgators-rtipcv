# Real-Time Image Processing & Computer Vision

## Preliminary Meeting Notes
Welcome to the **Real-Time Image Processing Project**! This document outlines key details discussed in our first preliminary meeting and sets expectations for how development will proceed. 

## Development Workflow
- This project operates primarily through **GitHub and Discord**. There is no daily oversightâ€”everything is hands-off aside from **monthly meetings**.
- If you're new to GitHub, please **fork** the repository before cloning it.
- The **README** in the repo provides a **basic scope** of the project, but it is not set in stone. The project should evolve as development progresses.
- When working on code:
  - Create a **folder named after your GitHub username** inside your fork.
  - Push your work to your forked repository.
  - If your contributions are solid, we can merge them into the main branch.

## Resources & Project Longevity
- The repository contains **a lot of resources** to help with development.
- This project is designed to be an **ongoing, open-source effort**â€”if you want to continue working on it indefinitely, you can!
- If you want to **buy the hardware (Basys 3 + OV7670 Camera)**, you can develop independently for as long as you like.
- If more contributors join, we could even have **multiple different solutions** tailored for various formats and implementations.

## Open-Source Collaboration
- The project follows an **open-source development model**â€”contributions are welcome at any time.
- All work is done remotely through **GitHub and Discord**.
- The project includes **VHDL code and SystemVerilog (SV) testbenches**.

## Documentation Best Practices
- If you get **anything working in a testbench or do any worthwhile work (small or large)**, **document it**!
- It is highly recommended that you:
  - **Create a README** inside your fork to showcase what you've worked on.
  - Include **screenshots, explanations, and details** of what works.

## Getting Started
1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork** and start developing inside your `yourname/` folder.
3. **Join the Discord server** for discussions and updates.
4. **Document your progress** and submit a pull request if your work is solid/meaningful to the project.

We look forward to seeing what you come up with. Happy coding! ðŸš€
